# Responsive analogue html clock

This is a simple implementation of a analogue clock, written in javascript, to be executed in a web browser. The purpose of the project is to show an alternative way to draw lines and circles as divs instead of using a canvas.

## Getting started

Just clone the git repository and drop the index.html on your favorite web browser. Fix the bugs, come up with a better design pattern, improve the layout and hit me with a pull request.

## Live demo
